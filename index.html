            <h3>Public Speaking Experience</h3>
            <br>I started with conferences only by chance. One day I have been asked "ehy, there is the codemotion in rome, why don't we submit something?"... this way, without any detail, without context. The 1st answer? YES. Then I realized what I was going to face...
            <br>I don’t have specific conferences I like to apply to… yes, most of them are technical but not only. For sure I started with tech ones because I felt more comfortable with them since “speaking of tech stuff” is what I do each day of my life, it was my comfort zone. Then I started also with less tech confs, or with inspirational talks (both in tech and in not-tech conferences)… For example some Agile events (I am a QA… it’s not exactly my comfort zone, but it has been great great!)

            <br><br>Are they all good conferences or good experiences? Well, it depends… as experience, any conf is good… But let’s be honest, some of them are better than others.

            <br><br>I do prefer confs with “energy”, with audience really involved in what you are saying, where the audience is a mix of people (manager, developers, scrum, only nerdish-people, no tech people, students) because in that case, there is a real exchange of opinions, thoughts, and each part can learn from the other one. I do like to talk with people during a speech, to look at them, direct in their eyes, to understand if they are still with me or they are thinking of something else.
            <br>And if there is a really heterogenous audience, feedbacks are really important because speaking with people with your background is quite easy… the difficult part is to involve and make “others” be passionate with your topic (tech and not tech).
            <br>Personally, I had experiences also with really bad feedbacks (hard to manage, I admit), and they were soooo useful!

            <br><br>Another thing I do believe in, is that I don’t have to search for a topic because “I want to take part in a conference”, but topics arise by themselves everyday… I usually have a list of topics I need to talk about (yes, I need… sharing experiences and listen to others for me is a kind of need… in conferences, in books, in blogs…) and then there will be the perfect conference for each of them.

            <br><br>Ok, sorry…. Too many words, but I love this topic.
            <br> An advice? … HAVE FUN WITH THE NEXT CONFERENCES! <b>Try, experiment, find your own preferences!</b>
