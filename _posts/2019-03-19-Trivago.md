Do you really think that you can improve your daily tech work only by studying and developing 24/7? Without sleeping, without meeting boys and girls and without having a real 'not purely nerdish' life? 
<br>Let's try to think out of the box, the key could be different! 
<br>We will climb mountains and make blankets with crochet, we will play piano and fight Federer on a tennis court (ok.. maybe not this...). We will act in comedies and many other things! I'll show you how to use those kinds of experiences in your tech daily work.. to be tech-cool!!!
