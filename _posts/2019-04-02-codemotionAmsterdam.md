Are you stuck on using existing test frameworks and tools you can find in the web? Would you develop your own one? Are you really sure you want to reinvent the wheel? Well, we did it...
<br>Why? We are still trying to understand it.
<br>How? We will tell you.
<br>Results? Almost good.
<br>Mood? Row nerves.
<br>Everybody alive? Not everybody...
