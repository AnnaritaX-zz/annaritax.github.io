How many times have you thought it was unuseful to spend time in order to make tests as much usable, maintainable and automated as possible? 
<br> This question is the nightmare of developers and testers. Here, we would like to introduce a new architecture that, potentially, is able to reach a general agreement, by using technologies you all know but strutctured in a different way, that is using microservices.
<br>We will talk about previous good and bad experiences, our current solution and a lot of kittens.
