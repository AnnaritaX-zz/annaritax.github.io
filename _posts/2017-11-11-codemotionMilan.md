We would like to suggest a sustainable delivery process that defeated the chaos caused by their usage complexity and now stakeholders, business, developers, quality assurance and users are happier.
<br><br>Velocity + High Quality = $$$
<br><br>How can you use this approach to improve your business? What are the reasons why our nerdy world is so resistant to speed up time to market?
<br>Come with us in a nice journey through our experience in Hotels.com.
<br>Virtualization, parallelism, containers and other nice stuff for a final demo.
