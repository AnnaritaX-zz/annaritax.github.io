Every day a Tester wakes up and knows that he be going to test, every day one developer wakes up and knows that he be going to develop. No matter if you're a developer or tester, the goal is the same: release an excellent product for our customers.
<br>In order to avoid the testing bottleneck you have to consider: how to structure the development sprint, how to recognise critical issues, and act as quick as possible.
<br>Every day has its own importance for the quality assurance activities. We will discuss how to lead the team through the quality process, sharing goals and using testing as a development tool in order to obtain the same velocity and to reduce risks during the last day of development.
<br>Through Agile methodologies we will see how the QA role gain influence in the software development cycle distributing its help during all the sprint.
